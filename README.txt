Everything works including the ratings. 
For the rating methods, type "rate" to choose a product and rate it from 1-5(the capitalization of the action does not matter for any action).
Type "ratings" to choose a product and print its ratings. 
Type "categoryrate" to choose a category and a rating and it will print the products of that category whose average rating is above the chosen rate. 
The ratings are made by having a map whose key is the product id, and element is a Rating object.
The Rating object is a map where the keys are the ratings of 1-5 and the element is the amount of times it getes that rating.
